# A-Visual-Cryptography-System-for-detecting-and-identifying-tampered-images
Designed and implemented a secure image authentication system using visual cryptography and digital  watermarking techniques to detect and localize image tampering. Developed a robust algorithm to embed  encrypted watermark shares into host images, ensuring integrity verification without degrading visual quality.
